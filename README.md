# [Assemble v0.3.11](http://github.com/assemble/assemble) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/assemble/assemble.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/assemble/assemble)

> Get the rocks out of your socks.

Assemble helps you _quickly launch static web projects_ by emphasizing a strong separation of concerns between structure, style, content and configuration.

_This project just launched **so expect frequent changes** for the near future, and if you find this project interesting please consider starring it to receive updates. If you have any questions or have any trouble getting Assemble to work, please create an Issue, we'd love to help._

## Getting Started
_You must use Grunt.js version 0.4.0 with Assemble. Please upgrade if you're still using grunt v0.3.x. If you haven't used [grunt][grunt] before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started][Getting Started] guide._

 From the same directory as your project's [Gruntfile][Getting Started] and [package.json][packageJSON], install this plugin with the following command:

``` bash
npm install assemble --save-dev
```

Once that's done, add this line to your project's Gruntfile:

``` js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('assemble');
```

If Assemble has been installed correctly, running `grunt --help` at the command line should list Assemble's task or tasks. In addition, Assemble should be listed in package.json as a `devDependency`, which ensures that it will be installed whenever the `npm install` command is run.


## The "assemble" task
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `assemble` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

``` js
grunt.initConfig({
  assemble: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    }
  }
});
```

#### Run Assemble
_Run assemble with the`grunt assemble` command._


## Options
See the [Options](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/wiki/Options) section on the Wiki for more information.


### Task defaults
Task targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.


#### engine
Type: `String`
Default: `handlebars`

The engine to use for processing client-side templates. Assemble ships Handlebars as the default template engine, if you are interested in using a different engine visit the documentation to see an up-to-date list of template engines.

Pull requests are welcome for additional template engines. Since we're still working to update the docs, you many also contact [@doowb](http://github.com/doowb) for more information or create an [Issue][assemble-issues].

#### helpers
Type: `String`
Default: `undefined`

Path defined to a directory of helpers to use with the specified template engine.

``` js
assemble: {
  options: {
    helpers: 'assemble-helpers-handlebars'
  },
  ...
}
```

Handlebars, Assemble's default template engine, includes the following built-in helpers: {{#each}}, {{#if}}, and {{#unless}}.

[helper-lib][helper-lib] adds approximately **70 additional helpers**. To include them, follow these instructions:
  * Run: `npm install assemble-helpers-handlebars`
  * Add `assemble-helpers-handlebars` to the `options.helpers` property
  * To learn more visit the [assemble-helpers-handlebars][assemble-helpers-handlebars] repo.
  * See the list of [handlebars helpers][helpers-docs] here.


#### flatten
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Remove anything after (and including) the first "." in the destination path, then append this value.


#### assets
Type: `String`
Default: `false`

TODO...

Used by the `{{assets}}` template to resolve the relative path to the dest assets folder from the dest file.

Example:

``` js
assemble: {
  options: {
    assets: 'dist/assets'
  },
  ...
}
```
Example usage:

``` html
<link href="{{assets}}/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
Resulting in:

``` html
<link href="dist/assets/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
```


#### data
Type: `String`
Default: `src/data`

Load data for templates and [configuration][config] from specified `JSON` and/or `YAML` files.

Example:

``` js
assemble: {
  options: {
    data: ['src/data/*.json', 'config/global.json']
  },
  ...
}
```
Example `widget.json` data file:
``` json
{
  "name": "Square Widget",
  "modifier": "widget-square"
}

```
Example `widget.hbs` template:
``` html
<div class="widget {{ widget.modifier }}">{{ widget.name }}</div>
```

Compiled result after running `grunt assemble`:
``` html
<div class="widget widget-square">Square Widget</div>
```
Also see: [YAML front matter] todo...


#### layout
Type: `String`
Default: `undefined`

Path to the layout to be used.

``` js
assemble: {

  }
}
```


#### partials
Type: `String`
Default: `undefined`

Accepts [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) patterns to define the Handlebars partials files, or paths to the directories of files to be used.

``` js
assemble: {
  options: {
    partials: ['src/partials/*.hbs', 'src/snippets/*.hbs']
  },
  files: {
    'docs': ['src/files/*.hbs']
  }
}
```

#### ext
Type: `String`
Default: `.html`

Specify the file extension for destination files. Example:

``` js
assemble: {

  // Build sitemap from JSON and templates
  sitemap: {
    options: {
      ext: '.xml'
    },
    files: {
      '.': ['path/to/sitemap.tmpl']
    }
  },

  // Build README from YAML and templates
  readme: {
    options: {
      ext: '.md'
    },
    files: {
      '.': ['path/to/readme.tmpl']
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

Many, many more features are already implemented, and we are documenting them as you read this, so **check back frequently for updates**!!!


### Markdown

> Wouldn't it be awesome if you could just _use markdown however you wanted, wherever you needed it_?

Assemble gives you the flexibility to:

  * **Write entire documents in markdown**, and later compile them to HTML
  * **Keep sections of documents in externalized markdown files**, so they can be imported into other documents
  * **Embed or write "inline" markdown** on-the-fly inside HTML documents


_Read more about markdown features and `options` in the [markdown documentation](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/wiki/Markdown)._


#### "Include" or import externalized content

Use the markdown expression, `{{md}}`, to enable importing of external markdown content.

**Example #1: using full path**
``` handlebars
{{md ../path/to/content.md}}
```


**Example #2: using variables**
Or use a variable instead of setting the path directly inside the template. For example you can add the content variable to a YAML header:

``` yaml
---
page:
  title: Home
content: ../path/to/content.md
---
```
then use it like this:

``` handlebars
{{md content}}
```

#### Write "inline" markdown
The `{{#markdown}}{{/markdown}}` block expression allows markdown to be written "inline" with any HTML and handlebars content.

Example:

``` handlebars
{{#markdown}}
# Inline Markdown is awesome

> this is markdown content

  * useful for simple content
  * great for blog posts
  * easier on the eyes than angle brackets
  * even links look prettier

### Pretty links
[Visit Assemble](http://github.com/assemble/assemble)

### Even Prettier links
Embed handlebars templates to make them even prettier.
{{#page.links}}
[{{text}}]({{href}})
{{/page.links}}

{{/markdown}}
```

## Example Projects
Browse the [examples][assemble-examples] folder to get a better idea of what Assemble can do. To build the examples run `grunt examples`.


### Build Bootstrap's Grid with JSON or YAML
This example shows how to use JSON and handlebars templates to manipulate Bootstrap's grid system. We only have to define the grid one time using templates, then we can updated the grid columns, rows, and even content from a JSON or YAML file.


**Screenshot**
The finished result of the example project looks like this:

[![grid](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/blob/master/examples/advanced/dest/assets/grid.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/blob/master/examples/advanced/dest/assets/grid.png)

---

This is what our handlebars grid looks like. **_No really, this is the code for the entire grid!_**:

``` html
{{#grid.container}}
  <div class="container">
  {{#rows}}
    <div class="row">
      {{#columns}}
        <div class="span{{width}}"> {{md content}} </div>
      {{/columns}}
    </div>
  {{/rows}}
  </div>
{{/grid.container}}
```

And then we use an external data file, either `grid.yml` or `grid.json`, to configure the grid and provide the content.

**YAML version**
This is the data for our grid, written in YAML (`grid.yml`):

``` yaml
---
container:
  rows:
  - columns:
    - width: 4
      heading: Overview
      content: <%= content %>/overview.md
    - width: 4
      heading: Getting Started
      content: <%= content %>/getting-started.md
    - width: 4
      heading: Basics
      content: <%= content %>/basics.md
  - columns:
    - width: 6
      heading: Templates
      content: <%= content %>/templates.md
    - width: 6
      heading: Advanced
      content: <%= content %>/advanced.md
...
```

**JSON version**

And the same configuration writtin in JSON (`grid.json`) instead:

``` json
{
  "container": {
    "rows": [
      {
        "columns": [
          {
            "width": 4,
            "heading": "Overview",
            "content": "<%= content %>/overview.md"
          },
          {
            "width": 4,
            "heading": "Getting Started",
            "content": "<%= content %>/getting-started.md"
          },
          {
            "width": 4,
            "heading": "Basics",
            "content": "<%= content %>/basics.md"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "columns": [
          {
            "width": 6,
            "heading": "Templates",
            "content": "<%= content %>/templates.md"
          },
          {
            "width": 6,
            "heading": "Advanced",
            "content": "<%= content %>/advanced.md"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you're satisfied with the default `src` and `dest` paths in the `assemble`, simply run `grunt assemble` to compile the grid to static HTML. Or run `grunt watch` to continuously watch files and automatically re-build when changes occur.


## About

> The goal of Assemble is to offer:

* Conventions for building and maintaining static sites and UI pattern libraries, using HTML, CSS/LESS/SASS, client-side templates and structured data
* Patterns for highly reusable layouts, pages, includes/partials, "snippets" and so on
* Strategies for externalizing metadata, data and content into maintainable formats, such as markdown, JSON, YAML, text, HTML and others
* Ability to use simple JSON or YAML to configure and define the structure of entire projects, static sites or component libraries
* Configurable and extensible enough for programmers, but easy for non-programmers to learn and use.
