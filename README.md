</details>

## Quickstart

### Installing assemble

Add assemble your project's `devDependencies` using [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```sh
$ npm install -D assemble
```

You should now be able to run assemble directly (using `node assemblefile.js` etc) or using `npm` scripts. For example, add the following to package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "assemble"
  }
}
```

Then run

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Installing assemble's CLI

You can also assemble's CLI globally, which adds the `assemble` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

```sh
$ npm install --global assemble
```

_Note that even if assemble is installed globally, it's good practice to install it locally in every project to ensure that your projects are protected against any potentially breaking changes that might occur in assemble between development cycles._

### assemblefile.js

To use assemble's CLI, you'll need to add an `assemblefile.js` to your project. The fastest way to do this is to run the following command:

```sh
$ assemble
```

If no `assemblefile.js` exists in the current project, assemble will ask if you want to add one. If you answer yes, assemble will then generate a basic `assembfile.js` for you.

## CLI

Run assemble from the command line.

```sh
$ assemble <tasks> [options]
```

### Running tasks

Specify one or more space-separated tasks to run.

**Examples**

Run task `foo`

```sh
$ assemble foo
```

Run tasks `foo` and `bar`

```sh
$ assemble foo bar
```

### Specifying options

Non-task options are prefixed with `--`.

**Examples**

Set the `--cwd` to run an assemblefile.js in a different directory:

```sh
$ assemble --cwd=docs
```

Emit views as they're loaded and log them to `stderr`:

```sh
$ assemble --emit=view
```

See more [command line options](#command line options)

### Object expansion

Object-paths may be specified using dot-notation for **either the key or value** in a command line argument.

Additionally, assemble uses [expand-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/expand-object) (and some custom parsing) to make it easier to pass non-trivial options and commands via command line. So all of the following formats are possible.

**Examples**

Boolean values:

```sh
$ assemble --foo 
# { foo: true }
```

Key-value pairs:

```sh
$ assemble --foo=bar
# { foo: 'bar' }
```

Nested booleans:

```sh
$ assemble --option=foo 
# {options: { foo: true }}
```

Nested key-value pairs:

```sh
$ assemble --option=foo:bar
# {options: { foo: 'bar' }}
```

Deeply nested key-value pairs:

```sh
$ assemble --option=foo.bar.baz:qux
# {options: foo: { bar: { baz: 'qux' }}}}
```

Or on the left-side of the `=`:

```sh
$ assemble --option.foo.bar.baz=qux
# {options: foo: { bar: { baz: 'qux' }}}}
```

## Command line options

### cwd

Change the `cwd` for the `assemblefile.js` to run, optionally specifying any tasks to run:

```sh
$ assemble <tasks> --cwd [directory]
```

**Example**

To run the `scaffolds` example in the `examples/` directory, you would enter:

```sh
$ assemble --cwd examples/scaffolds
```

If successful, in the command line, you should see something like this:

<img width="527" alt="screen shot 2016-01-09 at 1 35 52 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/383994/12217685/0a14294e-b6d6-11e5-9e06-dc4738f0e53a.png">

### file

Specify the name of the config file for assemble's CLI to run, the default is `assemblefile.js`.

**Example**

```sh
$ assemble --file assemblefile.dev.js
```

## API

### [Assemble](index.js#L24)

Create an `assemble` app. This is the main function exported by the assemble module.

**Params**

* `options` **{Object}**: Optionally pass default options to use.

**Example**

```js
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = assemble();
```

### Templates API

Assemble exposes the entire API from the [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) library for working with templates and template collections. The API is much more extensive than what is documented here, see [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) for more documentation.

**Templates and Views**

In the following documentation, the terms "template" and "view" both refer to _aspects_ of the same thing. Here's what they mean:

* `template`: an actual template string
* `view`: a object with a `content` property that contains the template string. Since views are instances of [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl), you can think of a view as a "vinyl file for templates".

#### .create

Create a template collection for caching [views](https://github.com/cpsubrian/node-views):

```js
app.create('includes', {viewType: 'partial'});
```

**Options**

* `cwd` **{String}**: the base directory to use when loading templates onto the collection from a glob

* `viewType`: **{String|Array}**: One or more [view types](#view-types) to associate with the collection

**Add views**

Add a view to the collection:

```js
app.include('foo.md', {contents: new Buffer('this is contents')});
```

Add multiple views:

```js
app.includes({
  path: 'foo.md', contents: new Buffer('this is contents'),
  path: 'bar.md', contents: new Buffer('this is contents'),
  path: 'baz.md', contents: new Buffer('this is contents')
});

// or pass a glob (optionally override `cwd` defined on `.create`)
app.includes('*.{md,hbs}', {cwd: 'templates/includes'});
```

#### View types

View types are defined on a collection to determine how a templates in the collection will be handled throughout the [render cycle][].

**Available types**

Assemble supports three view types:

* `partial`: Views with this type are can be used as "partials" (or "partial views"), which can be injected into other views. Useful for components, document fragments, or other snippets of reusable code or content. These views are passed to rendering engines to be used as partials, or variables on the context if partials are not directly supported.
* `layout`: allows views to "wrap" other views (of any type, including other layouts or partials) with common code or content.
* `renderable`: Views that have a one-to-one relationship with rendered files that will eventually be visible to a user or visitor to a website. For example: pages or blog posts. The `renderable` view type is automatically set if no other view types are set.

**Defining view types**

You can define view types when a collection is created:

```js
app.create('snippet', {viewType: 'partial'});
```

Or directly on the collection options:

```js
app.create('snippet');
app.snippets.option('viewType', ['partial']); // string or array
```

#### .engine

Register template engine for rendering views with the given `ext`:

```js
app.engine(ext, fn);
```

**Params**

* `ext` **{String}**: The file extension of files to render with the engine
* `fn` **{Function}**: Async function that follows [consolidate](https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js) engine conventions, and takes three arguments: `str`, `locals` and `callback`.

**Example**

```js
// this engine is already registered in assemble
app.engine('hbs', require('engine-handlebars'));

// create a custom engine
app.engine('txt', function(str, locals, cb) {
  // render `str` with `locals`
  cb(null, str);
});
```

You can tell assemble to use the same engine for all file extensions by setting a value on `options.engine`.

**Example**

```js
// use engine `hbs` for rendering all files
app.option('engine', 'hbs');
```

Or, if you're using [.renderFile](#renderFile), you can force a specific engine to be used by passing the engine name.

**Example**

Use the `hbs` engine to render all templates:

```js
app.src('templates/*.*')
  .pipe(app.renderFile('hbs'))
```

#### .render

Render a view with the given `locals` and `callback`.

```js
app.render(view, {title: 'Foo'}, function(err, view) {
  // `view` is an object with a rendered `content` property
});
```

**Params**

* `view` **{Object|String}**: The view to render
* `locals` **{Object}**: Locals to pass to template engine for rendering templates in `view`
* `callback` **{Function}**

***

### File System API

Assemble offers the following low-level methods for working with the file system:

* [src](#src)
* [symlink](#symlink)
* [dest](#dest)
* [copy](#copy)

Assemble has first-class support for [vinyl-fs](http://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl-fs), so any [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) plugin can be used in your assemble pipeline.

#### .src

Create a [vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) stream. Takes glob patterns or filepaths to the source files to read.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Glob patterns or file paths to source files.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options or locals to merge into the context and/or pass to `src` plugins

**Example**

```js
app.src('src/*.hbs');

// define `src` options
app.src('src/*.hbs', { layout: 'default' });
```

#### .dest

Specify a destination for processed files.

**Params**

* `dest` **{String|Function}**: File path or rename function.
* `options` **{Object}**: Options and locals to pass to `dest` plugins

**Example**

```js
app.dest('dist/');
```

#### .copy

Copy files with the given glob `patterns` to the specified `dest`.

**Params**

* `patterns` **{String|Array}**: Glob patterns of files to copy.
* `dest` **{String|Function}**: Desination directory.
* `returns` **{Stream}**: Stream, to continue processing if necessary.

**Example**

```js
app.task('assets', function() {
  // return, to let assemble know when the task has completed
  return app.copy('assets/**', 'dist/');
});
```

#### .renderFile

Renders files as they are pushed through the stream.

```js
app.src('*.hbs')
  .pipe(app.renderfile())
  .pipe(app.dest('foo'));
```

Force a specific engine to be used for rendering files:

```js
app.engine('txt', function(str, locals, cb) {
  cb(null, str);
});

app.src('*.hbs')
  .pipe(app.renderfile('txt')) //<= use engine `txt`
  .pipe(app.dest('foo'));
```

***

### Task API

Assemble has the following methods for running tasks and controlling workflows:

* [task](#task)
* [build](#build)
* [watch](#watch)

#### .task

Define a task to be run when the task is called.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Task name
* `fn` **{Function}**: function that is called when the task is run.

**Example**

```js
app.task('default', function() {
  app.src('templates/*.hbs')
    .pipe(app.dest('site/'));
});
```

#### .build

Run one or more tasks.

**Params**

* `tasks` **{Array|String}**: Task name or array of task names.
* `cb` **{Function}**: callback function that exposes `err`

**Example**

```js
app.build(['foo', 'bar'], function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('done!');
});
```

#### .watch

Watch files, run one or more tasks when a watched file changes.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Filepaths or glob patterns.
* `tasks` **{Array}**: Task(s) to watch.

**Example**

```js
app.task('watch', function() {
  app.watch('docs/*.md', ['docs']);
});
```

### FAQ

**Website is outdated and being refactored!**

Assemble's website, assemble.io, only has information related to [gulp-assemble](http://assemble.io). We're working hard to update the site with information about the latest release.

In the meantime, you might find the [WIP docs](docs/src/content) useful. The [unit tests](test/) are also great examples!

**Is the assemble website up-to-date?**

No, as mentioned above, it's completely out-of-date. If you're using [grunt-assemble](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-assemble), some of the documentation at assemble.io might still be useful. If you're using assemble v0.6.0 and higher, the documentation is probably wrong in almost every way.

We're actively (daily) working on a refactor and it's a very high priority.

**What's the difference between [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) and assemble?**

Assemble adds a CLI, a few built-in view collections: `pages`, `layouts`, and `partials`, middleware for parsing front-matter, and a few other basic defaults that we've found many users expect. If you'd prefer different defaults, [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) is a great starting point.

If you want something that handles templates, rendering, engines, helpers, collections, etc. but you don't need to run tasks or work with the file system, then consider using [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) instead of assemble-core.

**I use gulp, why is it recommended to use assemble directly, instead of running assemble with gulp?**

You can run gulp plugins with assemble, but it won't always work the other way around. This is because, as a build system, assemble does things that gulp doesn't do, like handle middleware.

For example, assemble's `.src` and `.dest` methods have built-in `.onStream`, `.preWrite`, and `.postWrite` middleware handlers. If you still wish to use gulp and your build cycle includes middleware that requires these handlers, you can use the [assemble-handle](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-handle) plugin with gulp to ensure that the handlers are still called as needed.

This is a long way of saying, you can find ways to make gulp work, but you would just be adding an extra dependency to your project to do things that assemble already does.

**What is the relationship between gulp and assemble?**

Please read our [gulp FAQ](docs/src/subjects/gulp-faq.md) for more information.

#### [0.23.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.21.0...0.23.0) - 2017-02-11

**dependencies**

* Bumps [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) to get an update to [assemble-streams](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-streams) that ensures that `view` is decorated with `.toStream()` when created by `app` (versus a collection).

#### [0.21.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.20.0...0.21.0) - 2017-02-03

**dependencies**

* Bumps [assemble-loader](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-loader) to v1.0.0 to take advantage of optimizations, improvements and bug fixes related to loading views

* bump dependencies. In particular, there was a bug in [parser-front-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/parser-front-matter) where leading whitespace was removed after extracting front-matter, which caused the first line of indentation to be removed. This has been fixed.

##### [0.16.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.15.0...0.16.0)

* **Added**: `.log()` method, which also exposes additional methods, like `.log.info()`, `.log.success()`, etc.

* Moves some private prototype methods to static methods, to allow them to be used without creating an instance
* Bumps [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) to v0.25.0

##### [0.15.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.14.0...0.15.0)

* Bumps [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) to v0.24.0 to get the latest versions of [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) and [base-data](https://github.com/node-base/base-data) which removes the `renameKey` option from the `.data` method. Use the `namespace` option instead.

##### [0.14.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.13.0...0.14.0)

Bumps [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) to v0.22.0 to take advantage of fixes and improvements to lookup methods: `.find` and `getView`. No API changes were made. Please [let us know](../../issues) if regressions occur.

* fixes `List` bug that was caused collection helpers to explode
* Improvements to lookup functions: `app.getView()` and `app.find()`
* Bumps [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) to take advantages of code optimizations.

##### [0.13.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.12.0...0.13.0)

* Fixes bug where glob parent was not being used for `file.base`, causing dest directory to be relative to cwd instead of glob parent in some cases.
* Some changes were made to context handling that effected one unit test out of ~1,000. although it's unlikely you'll be effected by the change, it warrants a minor bump
* Externalizes common [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates) tests to base-test-runner, so that assemble plugins and other [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) applications can use the tests
* Includes a fix from [assemble-loader](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-loader), where a bug caused `renameKey` to not always be used when defined on collection loader options.
* Includes fixes from templates for resolving layouts

##### [0.11.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.10.0...0.11.0)

* `debug` methods and related code have been removed
* Bumps [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core) to v0.17.0

##### [0.10.0](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/compare/0.9.0...0.10.0)

* Updates [composer](https://github.com/doowb/composer) to v0.11.0, which removes the `.watch` method in favor of using the [base-watch](https://github.com/node-base/base-watch) plugin.
* Changes in [templates](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates). Please see v0.11.0 in [templates history](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/templates#history) for more details.
