### What we need 
We can always use help dwindling down the [Issues](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues), but here are other ways you can help:

  * **Documentation**: we can always use help with docs. Creating new docs, filling in missing information, examples, corrections, grammar. You name it, we need it.
  * **Tell us your experience with Assemble**: Use assemble, give us feedback and tell us how to improve, or add feature requests.
  * **Have an idea? Tell us about it.** You can contact us via GitHub issues or via email (found on author's profiles)
