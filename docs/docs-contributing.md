Want to help make **assemble** even better? All constructive feedback and contributions are welcome, so please consider contributing!  We can always use help creating, tests, documentation or resolving [Issues](https://github.com/assemble/assemble/issues), but if you have other ideas for how you can help, Brian and I would love to hear them!
