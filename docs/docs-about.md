> The goal of Assemble is to offer:

* Conventions for building and maintaining static sites and UI pattern libraries, using HTML, CSS/LESS/SASS, client-side templates and structured data
* Patterns for highly reusable layouts, pages, includes/partials, "snippets" and so on
* Strategies for externalizing metadata, data and content into maintainable formats, such as markdown, JSON, YAML, text, HTML and others
* Ability to use simple JSON or YAML to configure and define the structure of entire projects, static sites or component libraries
* Configurable and extensible enough for programmers, but easy for non-programmers to learn and use.

+ [assemble-less](http://github.com/assemble/assemble-less): a powerful and flexible [Grunt plugin](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) for compiling LESS to CSS. The `less` task leverages [JSON and Lo-dash templates](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) for defining any number of LESS "bundles", UI components, compressed stylesheets or themes.
+ [helper-lib](http://github.com/assemble/): An extensive collection of useful Handlebars helpers used in by Assemble (more than 75 at last count!).
+ [Upstage](http://github.com/upstage): **COMING SOON!** We are preparing to launch a library of seriously high quality UI components, each constructed following the same conventions we encourage with Assemble.
