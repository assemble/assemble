> The goal of Assemble is to offer:

* Conventions for building and maintaining static sites and UI pattern libraries, using HTML, CSS/LESS/SASS, client-side templates and structured data
* Patterns for highly reusable layouts, pages, includes/partials, "snippets" and so on
* Strategies for externalizing metadata, data and content into maintainable formats, such as markdown, JSON, YAML, text, HTML and others
* Ability to use simple JSON or YAML to configure and define the structure of entire projects, static sites or component libraries
* Configurable and extensible enough for programmers, but easy for non-programmers to learn and use.


## Coming Soon!
+ [Upstage](http://github.com/upstage): COMING SOON! We are preparing to launch a library of seriously high quality UI components, each constructed following the same conventions we encourage with Assemble.
