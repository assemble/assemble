title: YAML Variables

one: &DOOWB This is an example YAML variable. Variables need to be the first thing in the line. If it shows up in the result, it worked!
two: *DOOWB
---
<div class="page-header">
  <h4>{{{title}}}</h4>
</div>

{{{two}}}

{{#markdown}}
This would output the variable as literal text.
``` yaml
three: But this doesn't work. *DOOWB
```
And this would throw an error:

``` yaml
three: *DOOWB But this doesn't work.
```

YAML supports **variables**, or **repeated nodes**. The simplest explanation is that you define something as a variable by preceding it with "&NAME value" and you can refer to it with "*NAME" e.g.:

``` yaml
# YAML
some_thing: &NAME foobar
other_thing: *NAME
```
Parses to:
``` json
{"other_thing": "foobar", "some_thing": "foobar"}
```
