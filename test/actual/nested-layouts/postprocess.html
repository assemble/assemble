<h1>The Canterbury Tales</h1>
<h2>Prologue</h2>
<h3 class="translation">Modern English</h3>

But none the less, whilst I have time and space,
Before yet farther in this tale I pace,
It seems to me accordant with reason
To inform you of the condition
Of all of these, as it seemed to me,
And who they were, and what was their degree,
And even how arrayed there at the inn;
And with a knight thus will I first begin.
