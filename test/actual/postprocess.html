<h1>The Canterbury Tales</h1>
<h2>Prologue</h2>
<h3 class="translation">Middle English</h3>

But nathelees, whil I have tyme and space,
Er that I ferther in this tale I pace,
Me thynketh it acordaunt to resoun
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And whiche they weren, and of what degree,
And eek in what array that they were inne;
And at a knyght than than wol I first bigynne.
