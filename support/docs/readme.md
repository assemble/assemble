# Assemble documentation

**Content for new assemble.io**

Once the documentation in this directory is filled in a bit more, it will be built into HTML and used to replace the documentation that is currently used on `assemble.io`. 

**Temporarily broken links**

At that time, we'll be using a plugin to automatically lint and resolve links, render templates and so on. Unfortunately, until we start building the docs there will be lots of broken links and unresolved templates. 

**How you can help**

Please ignore the broken links, and instead help us:

- fix grammatical errors
- incomplete sentences (there are lots of those! sorry, sometimes I start a document and get pulled into something else before it's complete!)
- add documentation to cover anything we've missed
- let us know what you'd like to see in the docs
- add recipes

Anything else you'd like to help with would be most welcome!
