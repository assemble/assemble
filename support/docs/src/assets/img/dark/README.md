# Icons

> These icons were generated by [iconifier](http://iconifier.net/), a tool for creating "bundles" of Apple icon and favicon files for your website.

Most browsers will find the Apple icons in the root folder of your website. Add the following HTML to your page if necessary to specify other locations, remembering to include the correct path:

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="/apple-touch-icon-57x57.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="/apple-touch-icon-72x72.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="76x76" href="/apple-touch-icon-76x76.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="/apple-touch-icon-114x114.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="120x120" href="/apple-touch-icon-120x120.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="/apple-touch-icon-152x152.png">
```

## Tips

If your favicon.ico file isn't in the root folder, it's probably a good idea to place a copy in the root folder anyway as some web servers expect to see a favicon.ico file in this location and will add errors to the error log if the file is not found.
